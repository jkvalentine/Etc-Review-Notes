    "## Make The Confusion Matrix into a Profit Matrix\n",
    "* Calculate our expected profit assigning  weights to each probability of positive and negative\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go through the probabilities just like making an ROC curve. Plot!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of the x-axis as the percent predicted as positive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undersampling\n",
    "* Randomly discard majority of class obervations to achieve balance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "* Makes calculations way faster\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* Throws out data! Could be important, expensive to collect\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oversampling\n",
    "* Replicates minority observations, exact data points repeated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "* Don't discard data (valuable!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* Overfitting is very likely, giving more weight to data, assuming it is good data\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)\n",
    "* Generate synthetic minority class observations\n",
    "\n",
    "* ONLY sample minority data\n",

    "## How do we pick?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each choice gives us a different ROC/Profit curve\n",
    "* Compare the ROC/Profit curve"
